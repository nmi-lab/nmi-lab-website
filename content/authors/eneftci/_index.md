Dr. Emre Neftci received his M.Sc. degree in physics from Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Switzerland, and his Ph.D. in 2010 at the Institute of Neuroinformatics at the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich.  Currently, he is an assistant professor
in the Department of Cognitive Sciences and Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine. His current research explores the bridges between neuroscience and machine learning, with a focus on the theoretical and computational modeling of learning algorithms that are best suited to neuromorphic hardware and non-von Neumann computing architectures.
