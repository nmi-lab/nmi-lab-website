The NMI Lab strives to create computing systems that work more like the brain, by combining the fundamental and the applied. Our long-term research goal is to emulate high-level, cognitive function in dedicated neuromorphic hardware systems.

The lab's approach is to study neural circuits as computational substrates implementing a class of machine learning algorithms, and to design brain-inspired (neuromorphic) architectures that efficiently implement these algorithms.

Outcomes from this research range from brain-computer interfaces to goal-directed and adapting robotic systems.
